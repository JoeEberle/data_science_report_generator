This project creates a word document for data science projects that produces a report of the scientific process used to analyze the data. 

A **data science report or storyboard** is a tool used to plan, visualize, and communicate the sequence of steps,
findings, and insights throughout a data science project. It is particularly valuable for conveying complex
analyses and results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders in an organized and engaging manner.

Key Uses of a Data Science Storyboard:
1. **Project Planning**: It helps in outlining the objectives, hypotheses, data sources, and analytical approaches to be used in the project. This can guide the team through the project phases.

2. **Narrative Construction**: A storyboard helps in constructing a clear and compelling narrative around the data analysis. It allows data scientists to tell a story that connects the data, the analysis, and the insights in a logical flow.

3. **Visualization of Findings**: The storyboard provides a framework to visually represent key findings through charts, graphs, and other visual aids, making it easier to understand complex data.

4. **Stakeholder Communication**: It is a crucial tool for communicating progress and results to stakeholders. By presenting data and insights in a structured manner, it ensures that the message is clear and accessible to a wide audience.

5. **Iterative Feedback**: As a living document, the storyboard can be updated as the project progresses, allowing for iterative feedback and adjustments to the analysis or narrative.

6. **Documentation**: It serves as a record of the analytical process and decisions made throughout the project, which can be useful for future reference or for onboarding new team members.

In essence, a data science storyboard bridges the gap between data analysis and actionable insights by providing a coherent and visually appealing narrative.
