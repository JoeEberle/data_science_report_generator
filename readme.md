This project creates a word document for data science projects that produces a report of the scientific 
process used to analyze the data. 

A **data science report or storyboard** is a tool used to plan, visualize, and communicate the sequence of steps, findings, and insights throughout a data science project. It is particularly valuable for conveying complex analyses and results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders in an organized and engaging manner.

Key Uses of a Data Science Storyboard:
1. **Project Planning**: It helps in outlining the objectives, hypotheses, data sources, and analytical approaches to be used in the project. This can guide the team through the project phases.

2. **Narrative Construction**: A storyboard helps in constructing a clear and compelling narrative around the data analysis. It allows data scientists to tell a story that connects the data, the analysis, and the insights in a logical flow.

3. **Visualization of Findings**: The storyboard provides a framework to visually represent key findings through charts, graphs, and other visual aids, making it easier to understand complex data.

4. **Stakeholder Communication**: It is a crucial tool for communicating progress and results to stakeholders. By presenting data and insights in a structured manner, it ensures that the message is clear and accessible to a wide audience.

5. **Iterative Feedback**: As a living document, the storyboard can be updated as the project progresses, allowing for iterative feedback and adjustments to the analysis or narrative.

6. **Documentation**: It serves as a record of the analytical process and decisions made throughout the project, which can be useful for future reference or for onboarding new team members.

In essence, a data science storyboard bridges the gap between data analysis and actionable insights by providing a coherent and visually appealing narrative.

Description of HEDIS Measures:
In HEDIS measures, the Denominator represents the patients eligible for the measure, while the Numerator includes both patients who met and those who did not meet the measure's goal. The Exclusions are patients excluded for clinical reasons. The analysis focuses on the compliance rate derived from the numerator and denominator, highlighting areas for quality improvement in healthcare delivery.
